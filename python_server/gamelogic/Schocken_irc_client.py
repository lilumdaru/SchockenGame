#For example, if we ever want to connect to a list of channels (instead of just one as in this example) or change to a different server or channel we don’t have to find every instance
#and can just edit this variable instead.
#I’m using chat.freenode.net for this example. Other IRC networks will have you put in their name here.

#We don’t want to use and official/established channel while we do our testing. Aside from being rude, many channels have specific rules for bots or don’t allow them at all.
#Make sure you check with a channel’s moderators before adding your bot to a channel. For our testing, we’re using a custom, unregistered room (Denoted by the ‘##’ before the channel name on Freenode).
#This way we’ll be the only ones in the channel with the bot while we do our testing.

#Make sure this is an unused and unregistered nick as your bot won’t be able to connect if it’s already in use and it will be assigned a random name after 30s if it’s a registered and protected nick.
